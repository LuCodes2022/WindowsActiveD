Now you have the windows ISO installed.

## Setting up the VM

As usual the first step is the select the needed ISO, then select the amount of CPU, storage etc needed for your VM (I covered this in my linux server). Choose the standard desktop installation to have the windows server interface and not just the CLI:

![](/assets/interface_standard.png)

Once you select that you click next and choose to do a custom installation:

The select your drive and click next installation will start shortly after:

![](/assets/server_interface.png)

Now you will be prompted to enter your desired language and authentification information:

![](/assets/interface_language.png)
![](/assets/interface_ID.png)

Great now your server manager interface should open and you can begin setting it up!
