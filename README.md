# Windows Active Directory Server

This project was all about creating a windows server with a functional active directory, we also want to install sysmon and have a web app for Alice.

## What has been done

- Installing and setting up the Active Directory.
- Installing and setting up the DNS.
- Installing and setting up DHCP.
- Installing and setting up IIS.
- Adding Alice (Admin account) and Bob to user groups.
- Install Sysmon and make sure it is working.

## What I still need to finish:

- set up the authorization on my web app to only give access to Alice.
- make a simulation of a suspicious activity on one of the user computers to see how sysmon identifies it etc
