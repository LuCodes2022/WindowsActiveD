# Roles

## How do we select roles to download?
After our server finished the intial set up on our virtual machine, server manager should open on its own. Click on add features and roles:

once the set up wizard open click next:

![](/assets/addroles1.png)

Click on Role based or feature based installation and then click next:

![](/assets/adroles2.png)

Double check your server's information is all correct then click next:

![](/assets/addroles3.png)

Select the needed roles (Active Directory, DHCP, DNS, IIS (with windows authentification)) and then click next then install:

Once that is done, congrats you finished ading your roles!
